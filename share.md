## Show us your ev3dev projects

We have a [projects page] where users can browse projects that have
been built using ev3dev. You can add your own too!  Each project gets a
dedicated page for the author to explain what they have been working on, as
well as provide videos, pictures, build instructions, code, and any other media
that pertains to the project. If you have a project that you'd like to share,
check out [the tutorial][Adding a new project].
